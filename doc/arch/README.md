## ADRs

For any architectural/engineering decisions we make, we will create an [ADR (Architectural Design Record)](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) to keep track of what decision we made and why. This allows us to refer back to decisions in the future and see if the reasons we made a choice still holds true. This also allows for others to more easily understand the code. ADRs will follow this process (or its replacement):
